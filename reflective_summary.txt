Reflective summary — how Copilot was used:

I used Microsoft Copilot as an assistant during the InventoryHub project to:
- Generate boilerplate for the back-end minimal API and front-end components and API helper code.
- Suggest middleware patterns (request logging, API key auth) for consistent request handling.
- Help structure consistent JSON responses and DTO validation code.
- Provide quick examples for fetching and error handling in the React client.
- Offer small performance-oriented suggestions, like ordering items server-side and limiting response payload.

All Copilot suggestions were reviewed and adapted to meet the assignment requirements and security/simplicity goals.
